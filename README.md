eCommerce System


This eCommerce System is a robust PHP-based platform designed to streamline online shopping for dealers, customers, and administrators. The system operates with four distinct roles: Admin, Dealer, Employee, and Customer. It provides a complete framework for dealers to set up their own shops, manage products, and assign employees, while customers can browse and search for products by name, category, or shop name.

Key Roles and Features:
Admin: Has full control over the system, including managing dealers, employees, and customers. The admin can view all orders, profiles, and ensure smooth operations across the platform.

Dealer: Can create and manage their own shop, add products, and hire employees to manage the store. Dealers can also track their orders and customer interactions.

Employee: Assigned by dealers, employees help manage the shopâ€™s day-to-day operations, such as updating inventory, handling orders, and supporting customer queries.

Customer: Customers can browse the main page, search products by name, category, or shop, and place orders from different dealers. They have a user-friendly shopping experience with real-time product updates.
